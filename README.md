# Water-Management-System
Highly Efficient water level management system based on PIC18F4550.
Built a project “WATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM”, on a PIC18f4550 under HEDX. The prototype controlled the level of water in an overhead tank, water pumping operation and displayed the water level of the tank on a 16x2 LCD Display.

- Developed the C code for controlling the water level sensor and the water pump.
- Developed the C code for the LCD display driver.
- Tool: MPLABx IDE, Language: Embedded C
